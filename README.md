This repository contains code written on March 5, 2025 in the Microcontrollers lab of Dr. James Long.

Here, we demonstrate the implementation of Arduino Cloud services to access the Internet of Things with a pulse sensor device that calculates a patient's heart rate.
We took code from a previous repository, adapted it for compatibility with Arduino Cloud, and then created a dashboard to visualize our data.
